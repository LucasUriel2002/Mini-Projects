# Programming-guide-1
<h3>This will be a repository that i will use to study some basic programming concepts to improve my knowledge!</h3>
<h3>And also in this repo I will put the code I had written in the Basic JavaScript course from Scrimba.
In this course i have learned a lot of concepts and programming practices that i will remember forever!

The teacher Per Harald Borgen is incredible! his methodology and way of communicating helps a lot with
the understanding and made me feel very good when I was able to meet the proposed objectives!

The basic concepts covered in the course are very good to firm a strong base in programing logic!</h3>
